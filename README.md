# Evidence-2
It was a great class, though it was a bit confussing and complicated. Fortunately the professor was there to offer us his help in every program and mini case. Every class, the professor was very patient and comprehensive, and he was open to give us feedback in our activities, and not just feedback, but consultancies too.
I believe the most difficult progam in our class was definitely the one we saw in the mini case 2, which was the causal method.
